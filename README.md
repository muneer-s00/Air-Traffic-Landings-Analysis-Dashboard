## ✈️ Air Traffic Landings Analysis Dashboard

This project presents an interactive **Power BI dashboard** built to analyze air traffic landings data, focusing on aircraft movements, operational load, airline contribution, and regional trends. The dashboard enables stakeholders to explore landing frequency, total landed weight, airline dominance, and time-based traffic patterns to support data-driven aviation planning and decision-making.

## 📊 Project Workflow
**Data Cleaning & Preparation**
- Cleaned raw air traffic landing data to handle missing and inconsistent values.
- Standardized airline, aircraft manufacturer, and regional fields.
- Prepared structured datasets for time-series and comparative analysis.

**Data Analysis & Visualization (Power BI)**
- Designed interactive dashboards using slicers and dynamic visuals.
- Analyzed landing frequency and operational load across airlines and regions.
- Explored time-based trends to identify growth and seasonality.
- Performed correlation analysis between landing count and total landed weight.
